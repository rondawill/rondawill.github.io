                Hello My Name Is Sharonda, 
                My career goals are being my own grapic designer. I attened
                FIRST GDWD because I wanted to get deep in the grapic world
                field. FIRST had the perfect program for me, It wasn't to long
                and just right for me.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'm 32 yrs old, I live in the United States(Augusta,Ga).
                Although I would love to live my dreams out in anoter city.
                I would like to expan my learnings across the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                My passion is designing clothes,mugs,and logos.
                In my free time I research different things about my passion
                so I can master all my skills. I like to read up and watch
                videos to get a visual understanding of my passion.

            <p>
                People wouldn't know I was really into graphic design
                by just looking at me. People wouldn't know I run a business
                already with just looking at me. I love that part of life,
                because I love to see they reactions of things.
