                    Curry is the son of Sonya and Dell Curry. He was born in 
                    Akron, Ohio, at Summa Akron City Hospital, while his father 
                    was a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers.[7][8] He grew up 
                    in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent most 
                    of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets.[9] Dell 
                    often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games, 
                    where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups.[10]
                     The family briefly moved to Toronto, where Dell finished 
                     out his career as a member of the Raptors.[9] During this 
                     time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College 
                     boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated 
                     season.[11][12] He was also a member of Toronto 5–0, 
                     a club team that plays across Ontario,[13][14] pitting 
                     him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and 
                     Kelly Olynyk.[14] Curry led the team to a 33–4 record, 
                     en route to winning the provincial championship.

                <p>
                    After Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte 
                    and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School, where he 
                    was named all-conference and all-state, and led his team to
                     three conference titles and three state playoff 
                     appearances. Because of his father's storied career at 
                     Virginia Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball 
                     for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due 
                     in part to his slender 160-pound frame.[16] He ultimately 
                     chose to attend Davidson College, who had aggressively 
                     recruited him from the tenth grade.[17]

                <p>
                    Before Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats, 
                    head coach Bob McKillop praised him at a Davidson alumni 
                    event, saying: "Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is 
                    something special."[18] In his first collegiate game 
                    against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points 
                    but committed 13 turnovers. In the next game against 
                    Michigan, he scored 32 points, dished out four assists, 
                    and grabbed nine rebounds. Curry finished the season 
                    leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 
                    points per game. He was second in the nation among 
                    freshmen in scoring, behind only Kevin Durant of Texas.

                <p>
                    In his sophomore season in 2007–08, Curry had grown to his 
                    adult height of 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) and again led the 
                    Southern Conference in scoring, averaging 25.5 points per 
                    game while adding 4.7 rebounds per game and 2.8 assists per 
                    game. He led the Wildcats to a 26–6 regular-season record 
                    and a 20–0 conference record. As a result of Curry's 
                    exceptional play, Davidson earned its third straight 
                    NCAA tournament bid.

                    On March 21, 2008, Davidson matched up with seventh-seeded 
                    Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by 11 points early in the second half 
                    but Curry went on to score 30 points in the half[24] to 
                    push Davidson to their first NCAA Tournament win since 1969 
                    with a score of 82–76. Curry ended the game with 40 points 
                    while also going 8-for-10 from three-point range.[25]

                <h2>Golden State Warriors (2009–present)</h2>

                <h3 id="earlyyears">Early years (2009-2012)</h3>
                <p>
                    On June 25, 2009, Curry was selected as the seventh overall 
                    pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors.
                    [52] He appeared in 80 games (77 starts) during the 2009–10 
                    season, averaging 17.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 
                    and 1.90 steals in 36.2 minutes.[53] His second half of the 
                    season vaulted him into the rookie of the year race.[54] 
                    He was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for 
                    January, March, and April, finishing as the only Western 
                    Conference rookie to win the award three times.[53]
                     He finished runner-up for the NBA Rookie of the Year 
                     Award behind Tyreke Evans[54] and was a unanimous 
                     NBA All-Rookie First Team selection, becoming the 
                     first Warriors player since Jason Richardson in 2001–02 
                     to earn All-Rookie First Team honors

                    appearance (2012-2014)</h3>
                <p>
                    Prior to the start of the 2012–13 season, Curry signed 
                    a four-year, $44 million contract extension with the 
                    Warriors.[60][61] At the time, many basketball writers 
                    considered the move risky for Golden State because of 
                    Curry's injury history.[62] Over the course of the year, 
                    Curry and backcourt teammate Klay Thompson gained a 
                    reputation for their perimeter scoring, earning them the 
                    nickname the "Splash Brothers".[63] In 2012–13, Curry 
                    appeared in 78 games (all starts), averaging career highs 
                    of 22.9 points (seventh in NBA) and 6.9 assists to go with 
                    4.0 rebounds and 1.62 steals in 38.2 minutes.[53] 
                    He established a new NBA single-season three-point record 
                    with 272 three-pointers, eclipsing the previous mark set 
                    by Ray Allen (269 in 2005–06), doing so on 53 less attempts 
                    than Allen did with Seattle.
