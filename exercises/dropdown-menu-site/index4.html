                Prissy was found outside on Halloween night, when 
                she followed home a young trick or treater. Rather than throw 
                her back outside, the family decided to foster her until she 
                could find good homes. That's where you come in. She is 3 
                months old and weigh a bit over 3 lbs. She is very playful, 
                friendly, snuggly and sweet. She is not afraid of anything 
                and come up to everyone to meet and greet. She can be adopted 
                today. Give your family an early Christmas present!
