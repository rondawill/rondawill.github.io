                Hunny is an adorable rabbit! He’s a 12 lb rabbit who is 
                10-months-old. He’s a playful little rabbit who adores people 
                and has never met a toy or a treat he didn’t love. He’s the 
                perfect companion for a kid who needs a buddy. Hunny is 
                still learning to trust humans but loves to hang out near his 
                family. He also enjoys being pet and held. His foster is 
                working on leash training, but his ideal home would have a 
                fenced-in yard for his energetic zoomies. Hunny is both crate 
                trained and housebroken. Hunny will need a loving family with 
                the patience to help this boy learn to trust people. He has so 
                much potential and we can’t wait to find him the perfect home. 
                He is available for adoption.
