                            Christmas was traditionally a Christian festival 
                            celebrating the birth of Jesus, but in the early 
                            20th century, it also became a secular family 
                            holiday, observed by Christians and non-Christians 
                            alike. The secular holiday is often devoid of 
                            Christian elements, with the mythical figure 
                            Santa Claus playing the pivotal role.
