                    Turkey is great deep fried. Turkey is also very good
                    slow cooked on the grill. Turkey is one of the main items
                    for Thanksgiving.

                    Thanksgiving is celebrated as a means of giving thanks for 
                    family, friends, food, health, and other positivities. 
                    Some families incorporate religion by giving thanks in 
                    prayer, but Thanksgiving is a federal holiday and 
                    celebrated nationwide. In modern times, the holiday has 
                    come to symbolize gratitude, peace, and celebrating 
                    blessings.

                        Did you know Thanksgiving inspired the first frozen 
                        dinner? In 1953 a food distribution employee 
                        overestimated the number of turkeys to order and was 
                        left with 260 tons of frozen birds! The fast-thinking 
                        salesman ordered aluminum trays and recruited fellow 
                        workers to assemble premade, frozen dinners that could 
                        stand the test of time.

                        Eat till you burst, then shop till you drop! 
                        The post-Thanksgiving buying frenzy now known as 
                        Black Friday came into existence with the first Macy's 
                        Thanksgiving Day Parade in 1924 that kicked off the 
                        holiday shopping season.
