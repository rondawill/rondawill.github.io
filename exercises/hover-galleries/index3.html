                   New Year's is always the first day of a new year. People 
                   celebrate different. Some go to church while others throw 
                   parties.

                    As the clock approaches midnight on December 31, people 
                    gather at public squares, clubs, or private parties. 
                    They count down the seconds together, shouting “10, 9, 8…” 
                    until the stroke of midnight. When the clock strikes 12, 
                    there are cheers, hugs, and kisses.

                    The confetti in Times Square has thousands of people's 
                    wishes written on them. In 2015 "wishfetti" became a 
                    part of the tradition. People write their wishes for the 
                    new year and submit them to the Wish Wall in Times Square 
                    (or online) and those wishes are turned into the confetti 
                    that falls over the crowd at midnight.

                    Times Square first hosted a New Year's Eve celebration in 
                    1904 with a giant fireworks show but when city leaders 
                    banned fireworks a few years later, the ball drop 
                    tradition was born in 1907.
