           <b>Graphic Design</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession" target="_blank">
            profession,</a>
           <sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> academic discipline
           [3][4][5] and applied art whose activity consist in projecting visual
            communications intended to transmit specific messages to 
            social groups, with specific objectives.[6] Graphic design is an
             interdisciplinary branch of design[1] and of the fine arts.
              Its practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking
               using manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text
                and graphics to communicate visually.

            alt="Due to its interdisciplinary nature, graphic design can be performed in different areas of application: branding, technical and artistic drawing, signage, photography, image and video editing, 3D modeling, animation, programming, among other fields.[1]"

            The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that
            of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages.
            Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and
            the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation
            , and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes
            beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can
            be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being
            established linguistically, either orally or in writing,
            that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message
            into a graphic manifestation.[7]

        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of
            knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example,
            it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be
            applied in the aviation world[8] or space exploration.
            [9][10] In this sense, in some countries graphic design is
            related as only associated with the production of sketches and
            drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a
            small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can
            be applied.

            With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,[11] graphic design
            as applied art was initially linked to the boom of rise of printing
            in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture
            in the Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged as a distinct
            profession in the West, closely associated with advertising in 
            the 19th century[12] and its evolution allowed its consolidation
            in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in
            information exchange today, the demand for experienced
            designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the
            development of new technologies and the need to 
            pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of 
            the engineers who develop them.[13]

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using
            the term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,[14] although it
            appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of 
            Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions of 
            San Francisco, in an article about technical education 
            for printers:[15]
        </p>
        <p>
                An Enterprising Trades Union
           … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among
            printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of
            design at thei finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and
             develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
        </p>
        <p>
            A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the
            California School of Arts & Crafts advertised a course
            titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one 
            called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes were 
            taught by Frederick Meyer.[16]

        <h3>History</h3>
        <hr>
        <h5>Main article: History of graphic design</h5>
        <p>
            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion
            of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, 
            the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and 
            fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories
            , principles, practices, languages and sometimes the same
            benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective
            is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design,
            "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas
            , expression, and feeling to artifacts that document 
            the human experience."[17]

        <h3>The advent of printing</h3>
        <h5>Main article: History of printing</h5>
        <p>
            In China, during the Tang dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were cut
             to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts.
              A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known 
              printed book. Beginning in the 11th century in China, 
              longer scrolls and books were produced using movable 
              type printing, making books widely available during the 
              Song dynasty (960–1279).[18]
        </p>
        <p>
            In the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, Johannes Gutenberg
            developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace
            using movable type made with a new metal alloy[19] that
            created a revolution in the dissemination of information.[20]
