           <b>Graphic Design</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession" target="_blank">
            profession,</a>
           <sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> academic discipline
           [3][4][5] and applied art whose activity consist in projecting visual
            communications intended to transmit specific messages to 
            social groups, with specific objectives.[6] Graphic design is an
             interdisciplinary branch of design[1] and of the fine arts.
              Its practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking
               using manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text
                and graphics to communicate visually.

            alt="Due to its interdisciplinary nature, graphic design can be performed in different areas of application: branding, technical and artistic drawing, signage, photography, image and video editing, 3D modeling, animation, programming, among other fields.[1]"

        <p>
            The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that
            of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages.
            Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and
            the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation
            , and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes
            beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can
            be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being
            established linguistically, either orally or in writing,
            that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message
            into a graphic manifestation.[7]
        </p>
        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of
            knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example,
            it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be
            applied in the aviation world[8] or space exploration.
            [9][10] In this sense, in some countries graphic design is
            related as only associated with the production of sketches and
            drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a
            small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can
            be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,[11] graphic design
            as applied art was initially linked to the boom of rise of printing
            in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture
            in the Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged as a distinct
            profession in the West, closely associated with advertising in 
            the 19th century[12] and its evolution allowed its consolidation
            in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in
            information exchange today, the demand for experienced
            designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the
            development of new technologies and the need to 
            pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of 
            the engineers who develop them.[13]

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using
            the term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,[14] although it
            appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of 
            Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions of 
            San Francisco, in an article about technical education 
            for printers:[15]
        </p>
        <p>
                An Enterprising Trades Union
           … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among
            printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of
            design at thei finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and
             develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
        </p>
        <p>
            A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the
            California School of Arts & Crafts advertised a course
            titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one 
            called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes were 
            taught by Frederick Meyer.[16]

        <h3>History</h3>
        <hr>
        <h5>Main article: History of graphic design</h5>
        <p>
            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion
            of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, 
            the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and 
            fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories
            , principles, practices, languages and sometimes the same
            benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective
            is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design,
            "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas
            , expression, and feeling to artifacts that document 
            the human experience."[17]

            In China, during the Tang dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were cut
             to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts.
              A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known 
              printed book. Beginning in the 11th century in China, 
              longer scrolls and books were produced using movable 
              type printing, making books widely available during the 
              Song dynasty (960–1279).[18]
        </p>
        <p>
            In the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, Johannes Gutenberg
            developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace
            using movable type made with a new metal alloy[19] that
            created a revolution in the dissemination of information.[20]

        <h3>Nineteenth century</h3>
        <p>
            In 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design
             education in Great Britain, informing the government of the 
             importance of design in his Journal of Design and Manufactures.
            He organized the Great Exhibition as a celebration of modern
            industrial technology and Victorian design.

            From 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press was a leader 
            in graphic design associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, 
            creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style,
            [21] in addition to wallpaper and textile designs.[22] Morris' 
            work, along with the rest of the Private Press movement, directly 
            Art Nouveau.[23]

            Will H. Bradley became one of the notable graphic designers
            in the late nineteenth-century due to creating art pieces in 
            various Art Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number of 
            designs as promotions for a literary magazine titled
            The Chap-Book.[24]

        <h3>Twentieth century</h3>
        <p>
            In 1917, Frederick H. Meyer, director and instructor at the
            California School of Arts and Crafts, taught a class entitled 
            "Graphic Design and Lettering".[25] Raffe's Graphic Design, 
            published in 1927, was the first book to use "Graphic Design" 
            in its title.[26] In 1936, author and graphic designer 
            Leon Friend published his book titled "Graphic Design" 
            and it is known to be the first piece of literature to 
            cover the topic extensively.[27]

            The signage in the London Underground is a classic design
            example[28] of the modern era. Although he lacked artistic 
            training, Frank Pick led the Underground Group design and 
            publicity movement. The first Underground station signs were 
            introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a
            blue bar in the center and the name of the station. 
            The station name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916
            when Pick used the expertise of Edward Johnston to design 
            a new typeface for the Underground. Johnston redesigned 
            the Underground sign and logo to include his typeface 
            on the blue bar in the center of a red circle.[29]

            In the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 'intellectual
            production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw
            individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus
            moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. 
            They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, 
            clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.[30]

            Jan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his
            1928 book, New Typography.[31] He later repudiated the philosoph
            y he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained 
            influential.[citation needed] Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers
            such as Herbert Bayer and László Moholy-Nagy and El Lissitzky 
            greatly influenced graphic design. They pioneered production 
            techniques[citation needed] and stylistic devices used 
            throughout the twentieth century. The following years 
            saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread 
            acceptance and application.[32]
        </p>

        <p>
            The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with
            consumerism. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably 
            from within the graphic design community with the First Things
            First manifesto. First launched by Ken Garland in 1964, it was
            re-published as the First Things First 2000 manifesto in 1999
            in the magazine Emigre 51[33] stating "We propose a reversal
            of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and 
            democratic forms of communication – a mindshift away 
            from product marketing and toward the exploration and
            production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of 
            debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is
            running uncontested; it must be challenged by other
            perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual
            languages and resources of design."[34]
        </p>
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <p>
            Graphic design can have many applications, from road signs to 
            technical schematics and reference manuals. It is often used 
            in branding products and elements of company identity such as 
            logos, colors, packaging, labelling and text.

            From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation 
            of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and 
            thoughtful compositions of visual information – known as 
            information design. With the advent of the web, 
            information designers with experience in interactive 
            tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background 
            to news stories. Information design can include Data and 
            information visualization, which involves using programs to 
            interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, 
            and can be tied in with information graphics.

            A graphic design project may involve the creative presentation of

            The "process school" is concerned with communication; it 
            highlights the channels and media through which messages are 
            transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and 
            decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message 
            as a construction of signs which through interaction with 
            receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.
